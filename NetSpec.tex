\chapter{Considerations for the TC}
When elaborating the network requirements please consider 14 teams in all 3 leagues.
Although leagues saturate with 12 teams it is desirable to have some padding just in case.
Also, is important to consider that the average number of participants per team is 8 + 1.2 robots, although in the past we have had teams with up to 22 participants.


Please consider the following elements:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Average and peak LAN bandwidth
	\item Average and peak Internet bandwidth
	\item WiFi technology and standard (e.g.~802.11ac in the 5GHz band)
	\item Number of channels to support
	\item WiFi coverage inside the arena
	\item Ping times
	\item Number of required VLANs (encryption must be done by hardware)
	\item Number of required switches
	\item Type and location of the desired WiFi antennas
	\item @Home must not interfere with simulation leagues
\end{enumerate}
